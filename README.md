Run the installation script:
```bash
./install.sh

You might need to run it with sudo if you don't have write permissions to /usr/local/bin:
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

After installation, you can:
- Run `claudius` from anywhere in your terminal
- Find your config at `~/.config/claudius/config.yaml`
- Find your virtual environment at `~/.claudius_env`

To uninstall:
```bash
rm -rf ~/.claudius_env ~/.config/claudius /usr/local/bin/claudius
```
